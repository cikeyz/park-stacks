## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **ParkStacks**! This project is an interactive, web-based simulation of a single-lane parking garage, designed to visually demonstrate the **Stack** data structure and its "Last-In, First-Out" (LIFO) principle.

The main goal was to take an abstract computer science concept and make it tangible and easy to understand. I started this project to create an engaging educational tool that shows how data structures power real-world logic. Whether you're a student learning about stacks for the first time or a developer who enjoys clever visualizations, I hope you find this project both fun and informative!

## ‚ú® Features

Here are some of the cool things this project can do:

* **Interactive Stack Visualization:** Watch cars park and depart in real-time, clearly illustrating the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) behavior of a stack.
* **Animated Operations:** Smooth CSS animations for cars entering, exiting, and being temporarily moved to allow another car to depart.
* **Real-time Status Dashboard:** Keep track of available spaces, total arrivals, total departures, and a list of currently parked cars.
* **Dynamic Light/Dark Theme:** A sleek theme toggle that adapts to your preference and saves it in local storage for your next visit.
* **Clear User Feedback:** Receive instant notices for operations, such as when the garage is full, a car is not found, or a car has successfully parked or departed.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern interface that works beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Getting this project up and running is as simple as it gets. No complex builds or dependencies needed!

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/cikeyz/park-stacks.git](https://github.com/cikeyz/park-stacks.git)
    cd park-stacks
    ```

2.  **Open in your browser**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

And that's it! You're ready to start simulating.

## üí° Usage Examples

Using the simulator is straightforward and interactive:

* **To Park a Car:** Enter a license plate number in the input field and click the "Park" button. Watch as the car animates into the first available spot.
* **To Depart a Car:** Enter the license plate of a parked car and click the "Depart" button. If the car is not at the top of the stack, other cars will animate out of the way to let it pass.
* **To Use a Random Plate:** Click the "Random Plate" button to generate a sample license plate number for quick testing.
* **To Change the Theme:** Use the theme toggle button in the header to switch between light and dark modes.

## üíª Tech Stack / Dependencies

This project was built with a focus on fundamentals and a clean, vanilla implementation.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Core Logic:** A `GarageSystem` class that implements the stack data structure using a JavaScript Array to manage all parking logic.
* **UI Management:** A `ParkingGarageUI` class to handle all DOM manipulation, event listeners, and animations.
* **Styling:** Custom CSS variables for dynamic theming and animations.
* **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage for persisting the user's theme preference.
